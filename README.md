# sass-starter

This is a simple project to get you started with SASS. It sets you up with SASS with a web server, hot-loading of SASS files and compiling to css.

**Usage:**
To load the webserver, run the following in your projects root folder.
```
npm start
```


**To autocompile your SASS to CSS:**
Run the following in a new terminal window. 

```
npm watch-sass
```

**Testing:**

1. Run the above two commands
2. Have your web browser open to the side (so it's visible when you make your change)
3. Open sass/src/core/_variables.scss
4. Change the colour to whatever you want
5. Save
6. The web browser should automatically update itself with the new colour
