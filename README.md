# sass-starter

This is a simple project to get you started with SASS. It sets you up with SASS with a web server, hot-loading of SASS files and compiling to css.

**Setup:**
First start the webserver by running the following terminal command in your projects root folder.
```
npm start
```


Next, run the following in a new terminal window. 

```
npm run watch-sass
```

**Trying it out**

1. Run the above two commands
2. Have your web browser open to the side (so it's visible when you make your change)
3. Open sass/src/core/_variables.scss
4. Change the colour to whatever you want
5. Save
6. The web browser should automatically update itself with the new colour
